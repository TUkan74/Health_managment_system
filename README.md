## Technical Solution

1. **Architecture:**
   - **Backend:** Using C# with Windows Forms to create a desktop application.
   - **Database:** SQL Server for data storage.

2. **Data Access:**
   - Use Entity Framework Core for ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to interact with the database.
   - Define models for each entity (patients, records, prescriptions, users).

3. **Interesting C# Features:**
   - Use asynchronous methods (async/await) to improve application performance.
   - Implement dependency injection to manage component dependencies.
   - Use Data Annotations for data validation.

4. **Desktop Application:**
   - The application will run on Windows desktop devices.
   - Use Windows Forms to create the user interface.
